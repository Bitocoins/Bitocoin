Ok guys, we tested GPU mining with CCMiner, it works only for NVIDIA graphic cards this one.
Further Miners will be provided for other GPUs.

Here are instructions:

- Download the attached file Here https://kittypool.club/CCMINER-BTO.zip;
- Unzip file;
- Open and edit file ccminer.conf with note ++ software or similars;
- Change "cpu-priority" : 3, to how many CPU cores you want to use;
- Change "user" with your wallet address;
- Save and close file.
Finally RUN ccminer-x64  (this is for x64 windows users, for others you need to download the
matching version).
Watch your wallet coins grow over time.
Thanks everyone and good mining!
